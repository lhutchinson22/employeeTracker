<h1>Employee Tracker</h1>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>This full stack web application allows the user/business owner to view employees, view the employees by their role, add new employees to the mySQL database, and update the roles desired. The nodeJS command-line takes in the user information to allow them to interact with backend database, so that the business owner can organize their business.</p>

<p>To start the server, simply open the terminal and run: "nodemon server.js" if you have nodemon installed. Otherwise, use "node server.js"</p>
